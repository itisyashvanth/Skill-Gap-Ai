🧠 Problem Statement

Students and early-career professionals often struggle to identify the exact skills required for their target job roles. Job descriptions are inconsistent, learning platforms are fragmented, and there is no clear way to measure job readiness.

As a result:

Learners don’t know what to learn first

Time is wasted on irrelevant content

Skill readiness is not mapped to real job opportunities

💡 Solution – SkillGap AI

SkillGap AI is an end-to-end, outcome-driven career readiness system that:

Analyzes user skills against real job descriptions

Detects precise skill gaps

Generates a personalized learning roadmap with exact resources

Tracks progress and motivation continuously

Recommends jobs and internships based on verified skill readiness

The system ensures that learning directly leads to employability.
